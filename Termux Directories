Termux Project Directory

Termux project directory /data/data/com.termux/termux ($TERMUX__PROJECT_DIR) added in Termux app v0119.0 is an exclusive directory for all termux files that includes core files, app and plugin app files and the rootfs. 

 
 Termux Core Directory

Termux core directory /data/data/com.termux/termux/core ($TERMUX__PROJECT_DIR) added in Termux app v0119.0 contains Termux core files for the Termux app, like user settings and configs for the app, which and are independent of any specific rootfs.

 
 Termux Apps Directory

Termux apps directory /data/data/com.termux/termux/apps ($TERMUX__APPS_DIR) added in Termux app v0119.0 contains app specific files for Termux app, its plugin apps, and third party apps, like used for app APIs and filesystem/pathname socket files of servers created by the apps.

 
Termux Rootfs Directory

Termux rootfs directory /data/data/com.termux/files ($TERMUX__ROOTFS) contains the Linux environment rootfs provided by Termux.

Termux Home Directory

The Termux home ($HOME) directory exists at /data/data/com.termux/files/home ($HOME/$TERMUX__HOME) by default. However, $HOME value may be changed by some programs, like su wrappers (sudo, tsu) to /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.suroot so that root owned files are kept separate from Termux user owned files.

Packages should never install files to the home directory. Exception is only for package maintainer scripts (1, 2), which can be used to prepare initial configuration in $HOME for packages which can't do it on their own.

 
Termux Prefix Directory

The Termux prefix directory exists at /data/data/com.termux/files/usr ($TERMUX__PREFIX/$PREFIX) by default. It serves the same purpose as the /usr directory on linux distros and contains the bin, etc, include, lib, libexec, opt, share, tmp and var sub directories. It is exported as $TERMUX_PREFIX instead of $PREFIX in addition to $TERMUX__PREFIX in Termux packages build system.


Important: Do not confuse the /usr directory with Termux prefix directory /data/data/com.termux/files/usr. Termux never uses the FHS compliant /usr directory found on Linux distros for packaging purposes.All hardcoded references to FHS directories in package source files are patched and replaced with Termux prefix directory during build time , like /bin or /usr/bin will get replaced with /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin.
